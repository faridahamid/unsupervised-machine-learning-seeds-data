In the first file this code just perform the hierarihical clustering and the GMM clustring and perform little visualization to dendogram and graph to the data after using the algorithm on a seed data set which is on kaggle you can reach the data set through the following link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dongeorge/seed-from-uci/data
In  the second file this code there is a preprocessing to the data and visualizations to understand the data and the colerations between the features , performing PCA to the data and performing the Fuzzy_Mean algorithm and the entropy based algorithm . this is a seed data set from kaggle you can view it through this link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jmcaro/wheat-seedsuci
