# Seed Data Clustering â€“ Unsupervised Learning Project 

This project applies various unsupervised machine learning techniques to a wheat seed dataset to uncover patterns and groupings within the data without using labeled classes.

The dataset used is from Kaggle and can be found here:  
- [Wheat Seeds Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jmcaro/wheat-seedsuci)  
- [Wheat Seeds Dataset 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dongeorge/seed-from-uci/data)
